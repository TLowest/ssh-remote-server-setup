This project demostrates how to provision a remote Linux server on AWS, configure secure SSH access using two distinct locally generated key pairs, and optionally enhance server security with tools like Fail2Ban. It is designed to build foundational skills in Linux server setup, SSH key management, and remote access hardening.
